\chapter{Devices}
\section{Overview}

In Calimero KNX devices were represented through the \lstinline!Datapoint! class. Instances of this class could be used to send and receive messages by passing it as a parameter to a \lstinline!ProcessCommunicator!.

In Scalimero a more decentralized approach was chosen. Devices were introduced.

\paragraph{Devices have the following members(constructor parameter):}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{A KNX address}
  
    Can be passed as a String or GroupAddress object to the constructor of Device.
  \item \textbf{DPType}
  
    \lstinline{DPType} is a wrapper class for \lstinline{DPT}, which means a instance of DPType or DPT can be passed as constructor parameter.
  \item \textbf{Name}[optional]
  
    The name is a String an will be given to the DataPoint instance encapsulated in the Device class.
  \item \textbf{Network}[optional]
  
    If this parameter is not given, the value of Network.default will be taken.
\end{itemize}
