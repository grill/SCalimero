\chapter{Installation}

To use Scalimero, you need both the Calimero KNX/EIB library and Scalimero itself. They are located at \url{http://github.com/grill/SCalimero/downloads}. Somehow put them on your classpath and you should be fine. The following launches a Scala REPL with Scalimero (assuming the jars are in the current directory):
\begin{lstlisting}
scala -cp calimero-2.0a4.jar -cp scalimero_2.8.0-1.0.jar
\end{lstlisting}

To add them both to an sbt project, add the following to your sbt project definition:
\begin{lstlisting}
  val calimeroDependency = "tuwien.auto" % "calimero" % "2.0a4" from
    "http://github.com/downloads/grill/SCalimero/calimero-2.0a4.jar",
  val scalimeroDependency = "tuwien.auto" % "scalimero" % "1.0" from
    "http://github.com/downloads/grill/SCalimero/scalimero_2.8.0-1.0.jar"
\end{lstlisting}

Remember you can launch a REPL in sbt by using the \lstinline!console! action.
